## qrbp is an r package for generating quasi random background points for Poisson point process models.

The package aims to setup a model matrix for point process modelling of single or mulitple (marked) point processes. The package is based on the quadrature scheme proposed by Berman & Turner 1993, and Warton & Shepard 2010. The idea bebind this package is simple, provided a set of presences for a species (or multiple species) and a spatial region, we can generate generate a model matrix which can be included in a Poisson point process model.  

Quasi-random points are an alternative to grid-based or random background point designs. Quasi-random (sampling) background points are an advanced form of spatially-balanced survey design or point stratification, that aims to reduce the frequency of placing samples close to each other (relative to simple randomisations or grid designs). A quasi-random background point design improves efficiency of background point sampling (and subsequent modelling) by reducing the amount of spatial auto-correlation between data implying that each sample is providing as much unique information as possible (Grafston & Tille, 2013) and thus reducing low errors for geostatistical prediction (Diggle & Ribeiro, 2007).
